For the JDBC file to work, you need:
mySQL downloaded (remember where you download this, as you will need the JAR file from this)
XAMPP

1. Once you have those two things, open up XAMPP.
2. Make sure that Skype (or anything running on port 80) is closed or turned off (apache runs on port 80)
3. Turn on apache and mySQL
4. Go to you web browser and type 'localhost'.
5. Click on phpMyAdmin in the top-right corner
6. This is were you make your DB. The steps on how to do this are self explanatory. (Note: make sure VisitorID is you primary key)
7. After creating your DB, go to your eclipse project where your JDBC file is located.
8. Right-click the project folder, go to 'Build Path', and choose 'Add External Files'.
9. Find where you downloaded mySQL and choose the JAR file.
10. That should be it.
